Flux Editor boasts a ton of features, some of which are unique. Below are some of the key features of Flux Editor:

- and many more!

## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

You can find built binaries in the [Releases](https://github.com/kyteidev/FluxEditor/releases) page. (NOTE: since I don't have a code-signing certificate yet, you may encounter a "unidentified developer" or "Windows protected your PC" popup. Currently you can verify the install by checking the SHA-256 checksum, found below "Release Notes" in the "Releases" section)
