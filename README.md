## Why choose Narvik? <a name="why-choose"></a>

Narvik is different from other code editors and IDEs. Narvik is managed by the community of developers, unlike others which are managed by a company. This makes it easier to get your opinions on Narvik heard and your feature requests implemented.

Narvik is also incredibly lightweight, as it was designed with simplicity and performance in mind, choosing more lightweight libraries instead of simpler but heavier ones. This makes Narvik a good choice when coding on old computers.
