A minimalist, fast, lightweight, and open-source half-IDE for multiple languages, made with Tauri and SolidJS. Narvik's code editor is currently powered by [Ace Editor](https://ace.c9.io/). Narvik is designed to be easy to use, so that new developers can quickly start coding, instead of doing the setup hassle on other editors and IDEs.

Narvik is different from other code editors and IDEs. Narvik is managed by the community of developers, unlike others which are managed by a company. This makes it easier to get your opinions on Narvik heard and your feature requests implemented.

Narvik is also incredibly lightweight, as it was designed with simplicity and performance in mind, choosing more lightweight libraries instead of simpler but heavier ones. This makes Narvik a good choice when coding on old computers.
